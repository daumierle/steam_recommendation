Among these users, many has stopped playing games on Steam and/or hide their profiles. Thus, we use the 
[Steam API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) to get only active users from this subsets.

In the end, the final data consists of:
- Train: 5060 user_ids
- Test: 2211 user_ids
- Games: 27491 unique game_ids
